*I want to add the InventionInvestment resource to the invention show page through AMS json data and display amount and user name.
      1-create serializers for invention_investments and add associations
      2-create a invention_investment.js file
      3- With in the II.js file create a class for II, addHTML function, getIventionInvestments (ajax) fucntion, on click function.
      4-add button to Invention show page and div tags to store ajax data for II.
      5-add respond_to data to Invention show controller for II JSON data.


*FIX user show page currently shows invention_investments for users who are inventors

*Rename InventionInvestment to Investments

*FIX when you click on invention link from the invention index page you are routed to a nested show page, when you click on the invention link from II index page, you are routed to non nested invention show page.
